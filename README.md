StackTweeter
============

This is a topshelf application which will poll stack overflow for questions with specific tags and then post them on twitter under a specific user

When you run this up it will create a DB with 3 tables.

 - Settings -> put your SO user key in here
 - TweetUser -> put your twitter api key bits in here
 - StackTag -> maps a tag from SO so it gets sent to a specific twitter account
